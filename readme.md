## Overview

This is a password generator that takes user input to generate a password with numbers, letters and special characters.

## My process

### Built with

- Python


### What I learned

This project I learned a lot. I went over the basics of python, loops, boolean checks and importing modules. 

### Continued development

Things I want to continue learning is better utilizing loops. I would also like to get better at understanding functions and logic. I would also like to be better at writing more legible code.  

### Useful resources

- [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim) - This helped me how to establish my code base and learnign how to walk through my logic in writing code with excellent examples.
- [Mayan Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/@MayanwolfeStreams) - This is an excellent channel that not only teaches you how to code but how to research and look up documentation to help better direct yourself as you code.
